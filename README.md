# PokemonEmeraldGodot 
Pokemon Emerald made with Godot (4.1.1). One day when I was playing with Godot, learning how to use it. I thought why not remaking this classic game! So I extracted all the assets from the original game and started code. I stopped before finishing the battle feature. This repository doesn't contain copyrighted assets, all of theme are pixelated. All credit to Nintedo.
